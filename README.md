# The Problem
Less than 7 % of the of adult population in Tanzania have some sort of health 
insurance and studies have shown after the liberation of the insurance market in 
Tanzania members of the public  still mistrust the insurance industry mostly due 
poor claims experiences in the past. The micro-insurance industry in Tanzania 
faces many challenges such as lack of access to traditional distribution channels 
for health insurance products to consumers who have inconsistent income and 
are unbanked. Another challenge is how to ensure positive market discovery 
within the micro insurance industry.
# The Solution
BimaTika allows its members to access affordable health insurance cover by 
spending at registered merchants and earning health insurance cover benefits. 
Subscribers can process claims at health care facilities whereby payment and 
processing is done instantly electronically.
This allows private enterprise to gain customer loyalty and health care centers 
receive timely payment for services rendered. This makes BimaTika innovative 
products that is easy to access and meets a growing demand for affordable 
health insurance cover that is in line with daily lives of Tanzanians.
# How it Works
Once a user has been registered and has chosen an appropriate insurance 
package, they will be required to colect tokens, which they would have received 
after making a purchase from participating merchants.  This immediately adds 
credit to the userâ€™s insurance cover. When health care services are required and 
the subscriber needs to make a claim, they simply go to the desired participating
health facility where their identification and cover will be verified and payment 
made directly to the health care service provider once service is rendered.
